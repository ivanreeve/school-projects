Eudaimonia, for Aristotle, is the culmination of a virtuous life, lived in accordance with reason, within a supportive community. It represents a holistic and flourishing existence that goes beyond momentary pleasure and includes moral, intellectual, and social dimension.

Social Dimension of Eudaimonia

There are three kinds of friendship: friendship based on utility, friendship based on pleasure, and friendship based on goodness of character. The first two kinds of friendship are based on superficial qualities, so these sorts of friendship are not generally long lasting. Friendship based on goodness of character is the best kind of friendship, because these friends love one another for who they are and not for what they stand to gain from one another. Friendship generally exists between equals, though there are cases, like the father-son relationship, which rely on unequal exchanges.
